# ASPRentalRides

Topic is RentalRides. This application will be used for sharing available rides and even create your own. People will be able to book the available rides as well.
Further, ppeople will be able to search among rides already available and book them using filters.

I tried editing the css of this application but I went into an error. So, for now, I have developed my project using the basic MVC format.

I have 5 Models including Car, Segment, BookingList, BookingDetail and Cart.

With Home View, I have Ride, Cars and Segment view with it.

There are 4 controllers in the project. (HomeController, RideController, CarsController, SegmentsController).

I have used My Azure Database for explanation in the video. I have deployed the application on Azure.

Thanks.
